    <h1>Step 1: Buy a Domain Name</h1>
    <p>Your identity on the web starts here. Let's get technical.</p>
  </header>

  <section class="intro">
    <h2>What Is a Domain Name?</h2>
    <p>A domain name is your website’s address — like <code>yourbusiness.com</code>. It's how people find you online.</p>
    <p>But buying a domain is more than just picking something catchy. Here’s what you need to consider:</p>
  </section>

  <section class="tiles">
    <div class="tile">
      <h3>✅ Choose a Registrar</h3>
      <p>Use trusted registrars like <a href="https://namecheap.com" target="_blank">Namecheap</a>, <a href="https://godaddy.com" target="_blank">GoDaddy</a>, or <a href="https://hover.com" target="_blank">Hover</a>.</p>
      <p>Make sure they support easy DNS editing, WHOIS privacy, and full domain control.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="tile">
      <h3>🌐 Pick Your TLD</h3>
      <p>.com is still king for trust. Others like .net, .co, or .org are good alternatives. Avoid strange or trendy ones like .xyz unless you're branding specifically for it.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="tile">
      <h3>🧠 Think Strategically</h3>
      <p>Keep it short, easy to say, and hard to misspell. Avoid hyphens and numbers unless they're part of your brand. Check for conflicts on social media handles too.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="tile">
      <h3>🔐 Lock in Privacy & Control</h3>
      <p>Enable WHOIS privacy (usually free now). Make sure 2FA is enabled on your account. Losing a domain is easier than you'd think.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="tile">
      <h3>💰 Understand the Cost</h3>
      <p>First-year cost is often $9–$15. Watch for upsells and auto-renewal pricing that jumps to $20+ in year two. Some TLDs have premium renewals.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="tile">
      <h3>🧬 Advanced: DNS & Name Servers</h3>
      <p>Once you buy a domain, you’ll need to set the name servers to point to your host, or manage records like A, MX, and TXT manually for advanced control.</p>
    </div>
  </section>

  <section class="intro">
    <h2>Links to Reputable Registrars</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><a href="https://namecheap.com" target="_blank">Namecheap</a> – great for privacy & pricing</li>
      <li><a href="https://godaddy.com" target="_blank">GoDaddy</a> – large, reliable, but heavy upsells</li>
      <li><a href="https://hover.com" target="_blank">Hover</a> – simple, privacy-first</li>
    </ul>
    <p><em>Estimated Cost:</em> $10–15/year (with auto-renewals adding $5–10 in year two)</p>

    <h3>Feeling Overwhelmed Already?</h3>
    <p>You haven’t even picked a host, installed anything, or set up DNS. But what if you had someone who could take this step — and every other step — off your hands?</p>
    <p><strong>What if you had a friend in the business — your inside guy — who could do it all for just $50/month?</strong></p>
